# Seat Heating System
The Vehicle Monitoring is one of the major feature of our project .Based on that our supervisor will set the heater to essential temperature. In this project ATmega328 microcontrollers used along with temperature sensor, Push button, Heat generator, LED and etc.

So in nowadays everything is fetching automated and everyone is looking for the new products to made the life easier. In our project the main aim is to design and develop the system which is capable of monitoring the passengerâ€™s existence and Heat Monitoring and Displaying.

# Features
- The System will sense whether driver is seated or not.
- If Passenger was existed in the vehicle it will gives the indication.
- The temperature can be altered by driver
- Heater will generate the heat accordingly based on driver requirement.
- The passenger can modify the temperature by watching the display as the display is given in the system.
- Low cost system

# SWOT Analysis
- Strengths : The system is robust.

- Weakness : Its only pertinent for those countries which are having low temperature.

- Opportunities : It can be implemented by replacing heater by air conditioners so that it will be helpful in all the countries.

- Threats : Not suitable for average or high temperature environment.

# 4W's and 1'H
